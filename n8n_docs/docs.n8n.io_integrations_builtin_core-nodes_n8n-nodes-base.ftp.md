# FTP[#](#ftp "Permanent link")

The FTP node is useful to access and upload files to an FTP or SFTP server.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../credentials/ftp/).

To connect to an SFTP server, use an SFTP credential. Refer to [FTP credentials](../../credentials/ftp/) for more information.

## Operations[#](#operations "Permanent link")

  * [**Delete**](#delete) a file or folder
  * [**Download**](#download) a file
  * [**List**](#list) folder content
  * [**Rename**](#rename) or move a file or folder
  * [**Upload**](#upload) a file



Uploading files

To attach a file for upload, you'll need to use an extra node such as the [Read/Write Files from Disk](../n8n-nodes-base.readwritefile/) node or the [HTTP Request](../n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) node to pass the file as a data property.

## Delete[#](#delete "Permanent link")

This operation includes one parameter: **Path**. Enter the remote path that you would like to connect to.

### Delete options[#](#delete-options "Permanent link")

The delete operation adds one new option: **Folder**. If you turn this option on, the node can delete both folders and files. This configuration also displays one more option:
