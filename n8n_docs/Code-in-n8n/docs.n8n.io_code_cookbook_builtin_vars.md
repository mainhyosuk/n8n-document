Feature availability

  * Available on Self-hosted Enterprise and Pro and Enterprise Cloud plans.
  * You need access to the n8n instance owner account to create variables.



`vars` contains all [Variables](../../../variables/) for the active environment. It's read-only: you can access variables using `vars`, but must set them using the UI.
