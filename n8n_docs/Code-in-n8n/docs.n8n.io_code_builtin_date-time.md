Python support

You can use Python in the Code node. It isn't available in expressions.

Method | Description | Available in Code node?  
---|---|---  
`$now` | A Luxon object containing the current timestamp. Equivalent to `DateTime.now()`. | ![✅](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jdecked/twemoji@15.1.0/assets/svg/2705.svg)  
`$today` | A Luxon object containing the current timestamp, rounded down to the day. Equivalent to `DateTime.now().set({ hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0, millisecond: 0 })`. | ![✅](https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/jdecked/twemoji@15.1.0/assets/svg/2705.svg)

`_today` | A Luxon object containing the current timestamp, rounded down to the day. Equivalent to `DateTime.now().set({ hour: 0, minute: 0, second: 0, millisecond: 0 })`.  
  
n8n passes dates between nodes as strings, so you need to parse them. Luxon helps you do this. Refer to [Date and time with Luxon](../../cookbook/luxon/) for more information.

n8n provides built-in convenience functions to support data transformation in expressions for dates. Refer to [Data transformation functions | Dates](../data-transformation-functions/dates/) for more information.
