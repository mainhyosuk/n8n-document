# Workflow Trigger node[#](#workflow-trigger-node "Permanent link")

The Workflow Trigger node gets triggered when a workflow is updated or activated.

Deprecated

n8n has deprecated the Workflow Trigger node and moved its functionality to the [n8n Trigger node](../n8n-nodes-base.n8ntrigger/).

Keep in mind

If you want to use the Workflow Trigger node for a workflow, add the node to the workflow. You don't have to create a separate workflow.

The Workflow Trigger node gets triggered for the workflow that it gets added to. You can use the Workflow Trigger node to trigger a workflow to notify the state of the workflow.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

The node includes a single parameter to identify the **Events** that should trigger it. Choose from these events:

  * **Active Workflow Updated** : If you select this event, the node triggers when this workflow is updated.
  * **Workflow Activated** : If you select this event, the node triggers when this workflow is activated.



You can select one or both of these events.
