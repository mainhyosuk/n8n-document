# Pagination in the HTTP Request node[#](#pagination-in-the-http-request-node "Permanent link")

The HTTP Request node supports pagination. This page provides some example configurations, including using the [HTTP node variables](../../../builtin/http-node-variables/).

Refer to [HTTP Request](../../../../integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) for more information on the node.

API differences

Different APIs implement pagination in different ways. Check the API documentation for the API you're using for details. You need to find out things like:

  * Does the API provide the URL for the next page?
  * Are there API-specific limits on page size or page number?
  * The structure of the data that the API returns.



## Enable pagination[#](#enable-pagination "Permanent link")

In the HTTP Request node, select **Add Option** > **Pagination**.

## Use a URL from the response to get the next page using `$response`[#](#use-a-url-from-the-response-to-get-the-next-page-using-response "Permanent link")

If the API returns the URL of the next page in its response:

  1. Set **Pagination Mode** to **Response Contains Next URL**. n8n displays the parameters for this option.
  2. In **Next URL** , use an [expression](../../../../glossary/#expression-n8n) to set the URL. The exact expression depends on the data returned by your API. For example, if the API includes a parameter called `next-page` in the response body: 

```
1
```| ```
`{{$response.body["next-page"]}} `
```  
---|---  
  



## Get the next page by number using `$pageCount`[#](#get-the-next-page-by-number-using-pagecount "Permanent link")

If the API you're using supports targeting a specific page by number:

  1. Set **Pagination Mode** to **Update a Parameter in Each Request**.
  2. Set **Type** to **Query**.
  3. Enter the **Name** of the query parameter. This depends on your API and is usually described in its documentation. For example, some APIs use a query parameter named `page` to set the page. So **Name** would be `page`.
  4. Hover over **Value** and toggle **Expression** on.
  5. Enter `{{ $pageCount + 1 }}`



`$pageCount` is the number of pages the HTTP Request node has fetched. It starts at zero. Most API pagination counts from one (the first page is page one). This means that adding `+1` to `$pageCount` means the node fetches page one on its first loop, page two on its second, and so on.

## Navigate pagination through body parameters[#](#navigate-pagination-through-body-parameters "Permanent link")

If the API you're using allows you to paginate through the body parameters:

  1. Set the HTTP Request Method to **POST**
  2. Set **Pagination Mode** to **Update a Parameter in Each Request**.
  3. Select **Body** in the **Type** parameter.
  4. Enter the **Name** of the body parameter. This depends on the API you're using. `page` is a common key name.
  5. Hover over **Value** and toggle **Expression** on.
  6. Enter `{{ $pageCount + 1 }}`



## Set the page size in the query[#](#set-the-page-size-in-the-query "Permanent link")

If the API you're using supports choosing the page size in the query:

  1. Select **Send Query Parameters** in main node parameters (this is the parameters you see when you first open the node, not the settings within options).
  2. Enter the **Name** of the query parameter. This depends on your API. For example, a lot of APIs use a query parameter named `limit` to set page size. So **Name** would be `limit`.
  3. In **Value** , enter your page size.
