# Execution Data[#](#execution-data "Permanent link")

Use this node to save metadata for workflow executions. You can then search by this data in the **Executions** list.

You can retrieve custom execution data during workflow execution using the Code node. Refer to [Custom executions data](../../../../workflows/executions/custom-executions-data/) for more information.

Feature availability

Available on Pro and Enterprise plans.

## Operations[#](#operations "Permanent link")

  * Save Execution Data for Search



## Data to Save[#](#data-to-save "Permanent link")

Add a **Saved Field** for each key/value pair of metadata you'd like to save.

## Limitations[#](#limitations "Permanent link")

The Execution Data node has the following restrictions when storing execution metadata:

  * `key`: limited to 50 characters
  * `value`: limited to 512 characters



If either the `key` or `value` exceed the above limitations, n8n truncates to their maximum length and outputs a log entry.
