# n8n Form Trigger node[#](#n8n-form-trigger-node "Permanent link")

Use the n8n Form trigger to start a workflow when a user submits a form, taking the input data from the form. The node generates the form web page for you to use.

You can add more pages to continue the form with the [n8n Form](../n8n-nodes-base.form/) node.

## Build and test workflows[#](#build-and-test-workflows "Permanent link")

While building or testing a workflow, use the **Test URL**. Using a test URL ensures that you can view the incoming data in the editor UI, which is useful for debugging. 

There are two ways to test:

  * Select **Test Step**. n8n opens the form. When you submit the form, n8n runs the node, but not the rest of the workflow.
  * Select **Test Workflow**. n8n opens the form. When you submit the form, n8n runs the workflow.



## Production workflows[#](#production-workflows "Permanent link")

When your workflow is ready, switch to using the **Production URL**. You can then activate your workflow, and n8n runs it automatically when a user submits the form.

When working with a production URL, ensure that you have saved and activated the workflow. Data flowing through the Form trigger isn't visible in the editor UI with the production URL.

## Set default selections with query parameters[#](#set-default-selections-with-query-parameters "Permanent link")

You can set the initial values for fields by using [query parameters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Query_string#Web_forms) with the initial URL provided by the n8n Form Trigger. Every [page in the form](../n8n-nodes-base.form/) receives the same query parameters sent to the n8n Form Trigger URL.

Only for production

Query parameters are only available when using the form in production mode. n8n won't populate field values from query parameters in testing mode.

When using query parameters, [percent-encode](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding) any field names or values that use special characters. This ensures n8n uses the initial values for the given fields. You can use tools like [URL Encode/Decode](https://www.url-encode-decode.com/) to format your query parameters using percent-encoding.

As an example, imagine you have a form with the following properties:

  * Production URL: `https://my-account.n8n.cloud/form/my-form`
  * Fields:
    * `name`: `Jane Doe`
    * `email`: `jane.doe@example.com`



With query parameters and percent-encoding, you could use the following URL to set initial field values to the data above:

```
1
```| ```
`https://my-account.n8n.cloud/form/my-form?email=jane.doe%40example.com&name=Jane%20Doe `
```  
---|---  
  
Here, percent-encoding replaces the at-symbol (`@`) with the string `%40` and the space character () with the string `%20`. This will set the initial value for these fields no matter which page of the form they appear on.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

These are the main node configuration fields:

### Authentication[#](#authentication "Permanent link")

  * **Basic Auth**
  * **None**



#### Using basic auth[#](#using-basic-auth "Permanent link")

To configure this credential, you'll need:

  * The **Username** you use to access the app or service your HTTP Request is targeting.
  * The **Password** that goes with that username.



### Form URLs[#](#form-urls "Permanent link")

The Form Trigger node has two URLs: **Test URL** and **Production URL**. n8n displays the URLs at the top of the node panel. Select **Test URL** or **Production URL** to toggle which URL n8n displays.

[![Screenshot of the form URLs](../../../../_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/form-trigger/form-urls.png)](https://docs.n8n.io/_images/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/form-trigger/form-urls.png)

  * **Test URL** : n8n registers a test webhook when you select **Test Step** or **Test Workflow** , if the workflow isn't active. When you call the URL, n8n displays the data in the workflow.
  * **Production URL** : n8n registers a production webhook when you activate the workflow. When using the production URL, n8n doesn't display the data in the workflow. You can still view workflow data for a production execution. Select the **Executions** tab in the workflow, then select the workflow execution you want to view.



### Form Path[#](#form-path "Permanent link")

Set a custom slug for the form.

### Form Title[#](#form-title "Permanent link")

Enter the title for your form. n8n displays the **Form Title** as the webpage title and main `h1` title on the form.

### Form Description[#](#form-description "Permanent link")

Enter the description for your form. n8n displays the **Form Description** as a subtitle below the main `h1` title on the form. Use `\n` or `<br>` to add a line break. 

### Form Elements[#](#form-elements "Permanent link")

Create the question fields for your form. Select **Add Form Element** to add a new field.

Every field has the following settings:

  * **Field Label** : Enter the label that appears above the input field. 
  * **Element Type** : Choose from **Custom HTML** , **Date** , **Dropdown List** , **Email** , **File** , **Hidden Field** , **Number** , **Password** , **Text** , or **Textarea**.
    * Select **Custom HTML** to insert arbitrary HTML.
      * You can include elements like links, images, video, and more. You can't include `<script>`, `<style>`, or `<input>` elements.
      * By default, Custom HTML fields aren't included in the node output. To include the Custom HTML content in the output, fill out the associated **Element Name** field.
    * Select **Date** to include a date picker in the form. Refer to [Date and time with Luxon](../../../../code/cookbook/luxon/) for more information on formatting dates.
    * Select **Dropdown List** > **Add Field Option** to add multiple options. By default, the dropdown is single-choice. To make it multiple-choice, turn on **Multiple Choice**. 
    * Select **Hidden Field** to include a form element without displaying it on the form. You can set a default value using the **Field Value** parameter or pass values for the field using [query parameters](#set-default-selections-with-query-parameters).
  * **Required Field** : Turn on to require users to complete this field on the form. 



### Respond When[#](#respond-when "Permanent link")

Choose when n8n sends a response to the form submission. You can respond when:

  * **Form Is Submitted** : Send a response to the user as soon as they submit the form.
  * **Workflow Finishes** : Use this if you want the workflow to complete its execution before you send a response to the user. If the workflow errors, it sends a response to the user telling them there was a problem submitting the form.



## Node options[#](#node-options "Permanent link")

Select **Add Option** to view more configuration options: 

  * **Append n8n Attribution** : Turn off to hide the **Form automated with n8n** attribute at the bottom of the form.
  * **Form Response** : Choose how to respond when the user submits the form. 
    * **Respond With** > **Form Submitted Text** : Show a message to the user.
    * **Respond With** > **Redirect URL** : Send the user to a new page.
  * **Ignore Bots** : Turn on to ignore requests from bots like link previewers and web crawlers. 
  * **Use Workflow Timezone** : Turn on to use the timezone in the [Workflow settings](../../../../workflows/settings/) instead of UTC (default). This affects the value of the `submittedAt` timestamp in the node output.
