### Node types[#](#node-types "Permanent link")

This feature uses [Cluster nodes](../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/): groups of [root](../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/root-nodes/) and [sub](../integrations/builtin/cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/) nodes that work together.

[Cluster nodes](../glossary/#cluster-node-n8n) are node groups that work together to provide functionality in an n8n workflow. Instead of using a single node, you use a [root node](../glossary/#root-node-n8n) and one or more [sub-nodes](../glossary/#sub-node-n8n) that extend the functionality of the node.
