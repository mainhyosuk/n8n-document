# Advanced AI examples and concepts[#](#advanced-ai-examples-and-concepts "Permanent link")

This section provides explanations of important AI concepts, and workflow templates that highlight those concepts, with explanations and configuration guides. The examples cover common use cases and highlight different features of advanced AI in n8n.

  * **Agents and chains**

Learn about [agents](../../../glossary/#ai-agent) and [chains](../../../glossary/#ai-chain) in AI, including exploring key differences using the example workflow.

[ What's a chain in AI?](../understand-chains/) [ What's an agent in AI?](../understand-agents/) [ Demonstration of key differences between agents and chains](../agent-chain-comparison/)

  * **Call n8n Workflow Tool**

Learn about [tools](../../../glossary/#ai-tool) in AI, then explore examples that use n8n workflows as custom tools to give your AI workflow access to more data.
