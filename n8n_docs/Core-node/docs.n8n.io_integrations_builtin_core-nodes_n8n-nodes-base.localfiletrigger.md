# Local File Trigger node[#](#local-file-trigger-node "Permanent link")

The Local File Trigger node starts a workflow when it detects changes on the file system. These changes involve a file or folder getting added, changed, or deleted.

Self-hosted n8n only

This node isn't available on n8n Cloud.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

You can choose what event to watch for using the **Trigger On** parameter.

## Changes to a Specific File[#](#changes-to-a-specific-file "Permanent link")

The node triggers when the specified file changes.

Enter the path for the file to watch in **File to Watch**.

## Changes Involving a Specific Folder[#](#changes-involving-a-specific-folder "Permanent link")

The node triggers when a change occurs in the selected folder.

Configure these parameters:

  * **Folder to Watch** : Enter the path of the folder to watch.
  * **Watch for** : Select the type of change to watch for.



## Node options[#](#node-options "Permanent link")

Use the node **Options** to include or exclude files and folders.

  * **Include Linked Files/Folders** : also watch for changes to linked files or folders.
  * **Ignore** : files or paths to ignore. n8n tests the whole path, not just the filename. Supports the [Anymatch](https://github.com/micromatch/anymatch) syntax.
  * **Max Folder Depth** : how deep into the folder structure to watch for changes.



### Examples for Ignore[#](#examples-for-ignore "Permanent link")

Ignore a single file:

```
1 2
```| ```
`**/<fileName>.<suffix> # For example, **/myfile.txt `
```  
---|---  
  
Ignore a sub-directory of a directory you're watching:

```
1 2
```| ```
`**/<directoryName>/** # For example, **/myDirectory/** `
```
