# GraphQL[#](#graphql "Permanent link")

[GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is an open-source data query and manipulation language for APIs, and a runtime for fulfilling queries with existing data. Use the GraphQL node to query a GraphQL endpoint.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

This node can be used as an AI tool

This node can be used to enhance the capabilities of an AI agent. When used in this way, many parameters can be set automatically, or with information directed by AI - find out more in the [AI tool parameters documentation](../../../../advanced-ai/examples/using-the-fromai-function/).

### Authentication[#](#authentication "Permanent link")

Select the type of authentication to use.

If you select anything other than **None** , the **Credential for** parameter appears for you to select an existing or create a new authentication credential for that authentication type.

### HTTP Request Method[#](#http-request-method "Permanent link")

Select the underlying HTTP Request method the node should use. Choose from:

  * **GET**
  * **POST** : If you select this method, you'll also need to select the **Request Format** the node should use for the query payload. Choose from:
    * **GraphQL (Raw)**
    * **JSON**



### Endpoint[#](#endpoint "Permanent link")

Enter the GraphQL Endpoint you'd like to hit.

### Ignore SSL Issues[#](#ignore-ssl-issues "Permanent link")
