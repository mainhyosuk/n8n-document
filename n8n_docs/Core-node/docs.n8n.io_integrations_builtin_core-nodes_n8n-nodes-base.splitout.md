# Split Out[#](#split-out "Permanent link")

Use the Split Out node to separate a single data item containing a list into multiple items. For example, a list of customers, and you want to split them so that you have an item for each customer.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

Configure this node using the following parameters.

### Field to Split Out[#](#field-to-split-out "Permanent link")

Enter the field containing the list you want to separate out into individual items.

If you're working with binary data inputs, use `$binary` in an expression to set the field to split out.

### Include[#](#include "Permanent link")

Select whether and how you want n8n to keep any other fields from the input data with each new individual item.

You can select:

  * **No Other Fields** : No other fields will be included.
  * **All Other Fields** : All other fields will be included.
  * **Selected Other Fields** : Only the selected fields will be included.
    * **Fields to Include** : Enter a comma separated list of the fields you want to include.



## Node options[#](#node-options "Permanent link")

### Disable Dot Notation[#](#disable-dot-notation "Permanent link")

### Destination Field Name[#](#destination-field-name "Permanent link")

Enter the field in the output where the split field contents should go.

### Include Binary[#](#include-binary "Permanent link")
