# Rename Keys[#](#rename-keys "Permanent link")

Use the Rename Keys node to rename the keys of a key-value pair in n8n.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

You can rename one or multiple keys using the Rename Keys node. Select the **Add new key** button to rename a key.

For each key, enter the:

  * **Current Key Name** : The current name of the key you want to rename.
  * **New Key Name** : The new name you want to assign to the key.



## Node options[#](#node-options "Permanent link")

Choose whether to use a **Regex** regular expression to identify keys to rename. To use this option, you must also enter:

  * The **Regular Expression** you'd like to use.
  * **Replace With** : Enter the new name you want to assign to the key(s) that match the **Regular Expression**.
  * You can also choose these Regex-specific options:
    * **Case Insensitive** : Set whether the regular expression should match case (turned off) or be case insensitive (turned on).
    * **Max Depth** : Enter the maximum depth to replace keys, using `-1` for unlimited and `0` for top-level only.



Regex impacts

Using a regular expression can affect any keys that match the expression, including keys you've already renamed.
