# Extract From File[#](#extract-from-file "Permanent link")

A common pattern in n8n workflows is to receive a file, either from and [HTTP Request node](../n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) (for files you are fetching from a website), a [Webhook Node](../n8n-nodes-base.webhook/) (for files which are sent to your workflow from elsewhere), or from a local source. Data obtained in this way is often in a binary format, for example a spreadsheet or PDF.

The Extract From File node extracts data from a binary format file and converts it to JSON, which can then be easily manipulated by the rest of your workflow. For converting JSON back into a binary file type, please see the [Convert to File](../n8n-nodes-base.converttofile/) node.

## Operations[#](#operations "Permanent link")

Use the **Operations** drop-down to select the format of the source file to extract data from.

  * **Extract From CSV** : The "Comma Separated Values" file type is commonly used for tabulated data.
  * **Extract From HTML** : Extract fields from standard web page HTML format files.
  * **Extract From JSON** : Extract JSON data from a binary file.
  * **Extract From ICS** : Extract fields from iCalendar format files.
  * **Extract From ODS** : Extract fields from ODS spreadsheet files.
  * **Extract From PDF** : Extract fields from Portable Document Format files.
  * **Extract From RTF** : Extract fields from Rich Text Format files.
  * **Extract From Text File** : Extract fields from a standard text file format.
  * **Extract From XLS** : Extract fields from a Microsoft Excel file (older format).
  * **Extract From XLSX** : Extract fields from a Microsoft Excel file.
  * **Move File to Base64 String** : Converts binary data to a text-friendly [base64](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4648#section-4) format.



## Example workflow[#](#example-workflow "Permanent link")

In this example, a Webhook node is used to trigger the workflow. When a CSV file is sent to the webhook address, the file data is output and received by the Extract From File node.

[View workflow file](/_workflows/integrations/builtin/core-nodes/n8n-nodes-base.extractfromfile/webhook-example.json)

Set to operate as 'Extract from CSV', the node then outputs the data as a series of JSON 'row' objects:

```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8
```| ```
`{ "row": { "0": "apple", "1": "1", "2": "2", "3": "3" } ... `
```  
---|---  
  
Receiving files with a webhook

Select the Webhook Node's **Add Options** button and select **Raw body** , then enable that setting to get the node to output the binary file that the subsequent node is expecting.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

### Input Binary Field[#](#input-binary-field "Permanent link")

Enter the name of the field from the node input data that contains the binary file. The default is 'data'.

### Destination Output Field[#](#destination-output-field "Permanent link")

Enter the name of the field in the node output that will contain the extracted data.

This parameter is only available for these operations:

  * Extract From JSON
  * Extract From ICS
  * Extract From Text File
  * Move File to Base64 String
