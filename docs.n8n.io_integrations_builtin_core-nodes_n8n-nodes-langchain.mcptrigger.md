# MCP Server Trigger node[#](#mcp-server-trigger-node "Permanent link")

Use the MCP Server Trigger node to allow n8n to act as a [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) server, making n8n tools and workflows available to MCP clients.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node [here](../../credentials/httprequest/).

## How the MCP Server Trigger node works[#](#how-the-mcp-server-trigger-node-works "Permanent link")

The MCP Server Trigger node acts as an entry point into n8n for MCP clients. It operates by exposing a URL that MCP clients can interact with to access n8n tools.

Unlike conventional [trigger nodes](../../../../glossary/#trigger-node-n8n), which respond to events and pass their output to the next [connected node](../../../../workflows/components/connections/), the MCP Server Trigger node only connects to and executes [tool](../../../../advanced-ai/examples/understand-tools/) nodes. Clients can list the available tools and call individual tools to perform work.

You can expose n8n workflows to clients by attaching them with the [Custom n8n Workflow Tool](../../cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolworkflow/) node.

Server-Sent Events (SSE) support

The MCP Server Trigger node supports [Server-Sent Events (SSE)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports#server-sent-events-sse), a long-lived transport built on top of HTTP, for connections between clients and the server. It currently doesn't support [standard input/output (stdio)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports#standard-input%2Foutput-stdio) transport.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

Use these parameters to configure your node.

### MCP URL[#](#mcp-url "Permanent link")

The MCP Server Trigger node has two **MCP URLs** : test and production. n8n displays the URLs at the top of the node panel.

Select **Test URL** or **Production URL** to toggle which URL n8n displays.

  * **Test** : n8n registers a test MCP URL when you select **Listen for Test Event** or **Test workflow** , if the workflow isn't active. When you call the MCP URL, n8n displays the data in the workflow.
  * **Production** : n8n registers a production MCP URL when you activate the workflow. When using the production URL, n8n doesn't display the data in the workflow. You can still view workflow data for a production execution: select the **Executions** tab in the workflow, then select the workflow execution you want to view.



### Authentication[#](#authentication "Permanent link")

You can require authentication for clients connecting to your MCP URL. Choose from these authentication methods:

  * Bearer auth
  * Header auth



Refer to the [HTTP request credentials](../../credentials/httprequest/) for more information on setting up each credential type.

### Path[#](#path "Permanent link")

By default, this field contains a randomly generated MCP URL path, to avoid conflicts with other MCP Server Trigger nodes. 

You can manually specify a URL path, including adding route parameters. For example, you may need to do this if you use n8n to prototype an API and want consistent endpoint URLs.

The **Path** field can take the following formats:

  * `/:variable`
  * `/path/:variable`
  * `/:variable/path`
  * `/:variable1/path/:variable2`
  * `/:variable1/:variable2`

### Integrating with Claude Desktop[#](#integrating-with-claude-desktop "Permanent link")

You can connect to the MCP Server Trigger node from [Claude Desktop](https://claude.ai/download) by running a gateway to proxy SSE messages to stdio-based servers.

To do so, add the following to your Claude Desktop configuration:

```
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15
```| ```
`{ "mcpServers":{ "n8n":{ "command":"npx", "args":[ "-y", "supergateway", "--sse", "<MCP_URL>", "--header", "Authorization: Bearer <MCP_BEARER_TOKEN>" ] } } } `
```  
---|---  
  
Be sure to replace the `<MCP_URL>` and `<MCP_BEARER_TOKEN>` placeholders with the values from your MCP Server Trigger node parameters and credentials.

## Limitations[#](#limitations "Permanent link")

### Configuring the MCP Server Trigger node with webhook replicas[#](#configuring-the-mcp-server-trigger-node-with-webhook-replicas "Permanent link")

The MCP Server Trigger node relies on Server-Sent Events (SSE), which require the same server instance to handle persistent connections. This can cause problems when running n8n in [queue mode](../../../../hosting/scaling/queue-mode/) depending on your [webhook processor](../../../../hosting/scaling/queue-mode/#webhook-processors) configuration:

  * If you use queue mode with a **single webhook replica** , the MCP Server Trigger node works as expected.
  * If you run **multiple webhook replicas** , you need to route all `/mcp*` requests to a single, dedicated webhook replica. Create a separate replica set with one webhook container for MCP requests. Afterward, update your ingress or load balancer configuration to direct all `/mcp*` traffic to that instance.



Caution when running with multiple webhook replicas

If you run an MCP Server Trigger node with multiple webhook replicas and don't route all `/mcp*` requests to a single, dedicated webhook replica, your SSE connections will frequently break or fail to reliably deliver events.

## Related resources[#](#related-resources "Permanent link")

n8n also provides an [MCP Client Tool](../../cluster-nodes/sub-nodes/n8n-nodes-langchain.toolmcp/) node that allows you to connect your n8n AI agents to external tools.

Refer to the [MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) and [MCP specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/) for more details about the protocol, servers, and clients.
