# Switch[#](#switch "Permanent link")

Use the Switch node to route a workflow conditionally based on comparison operations. It's similar to the [IF](../n8n-nodes-base.if/) node, but supports multiple output routes.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

Select the **Mode** the node should use:

  * **Rules** : Select this mode to build a matching rule for each output.
  * **Expression** : Select this mode to write an expression to return the output index programmatically.



Node configuration depends on the **Mode** you select.

### Rules[#](#rules "Permanent link")

To configure the node with this operation, use these parameters:

  * Create **Routing Rules** to define comparison conditions.
    * Use the data type dropdown to select the data type and comparison operation type for your condition. For example, to create a rules for dates after a particular date, select **Date & Time > is after**.
    * The fields and values to enter into the condition change based on the data type and comparison you select. Refer to [Available data type comparisons](#available-data-type-comparisons) for a full list of all comparisons by data type.
  * **Rename Output** : Turn this control on to rename the output field to put matching data into. Enter your desired **Output Name**.



Select **Add Routing Rule** to add more rules.

#### Rule options[#](#rule-options "Permanent link")

You can further configure the node with this operation using these **Options** :

  * **Fallback Output** : Choose how to route the workflow when an item doesn't match any of the rules or conditions.
    * **None** : Ignore the item. This is the default behavior.
    * **Extra Output** : Send items to an extra, separate output.
    * **Output 0** : Send items to the same output as those matching the first rule.
  * **Ignore Case** : Set whether to ignore letter case when evaluating conditions (turned on) or enforce letter case (turned off).
  * **Less Strict Type Validation** : Set whether you want n8n to attempt to convert value types based on the operator you choose (turned on) or not (turned off).
  * **Send data to all matching outputs** : Set whether to send data to all outputs meeting conditions (turned on) or whether to send the data to the first output matching the conditions (turned off).



### Expression[#](#expression "Permanent link")

To configure the node with this operation, use these parameters:

  * **Number of Outputs** : Set how many outputs the node should have.
  * **Output Index** : Create an expression to calculate which input item should be routed to which output. The expression must return a number.
