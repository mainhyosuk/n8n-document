# n8n[#](#n8n "Permanent link")

A node to integrate with n8n itself. This node allows you to consume the [n8n API](../../../../api/) in your workflows.

Refer to the [n8n REST API documentation](../../../../api/) for more information on using the n8n API. Refer to [API endpoint reference](../../../../api/api-reference/) for working with the API endpoints directly.

Credentials

You can find authentication information for this node in the [API authentication](../../../../api/authentication/) documentation.

SSL

This node doesn't support SSL. If your server requires an SSL connection, use the [HTTP Request node](../n8n-nodes-base.httprequest/) to call the [n8n API](../../../../api/). The HTTP Request node has options to [provide the SSL certificate](../../credentials/httprequest/#provide-an-ssl-certificate).
