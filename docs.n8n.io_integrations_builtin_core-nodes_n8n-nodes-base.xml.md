# XML[#](#xml "Permanent link")

Use the XML node to convert data from and to XML.

Binary files

If your XML is within a binary file, use the [Extract from File](../n8n-nodes-base.extractfromfile/) node to convert it to text first.

## Node parameters[#](#node-parameters "Permanent link")

  * **Mode** : The format the data should be converted from and to.
    * **JSON to XML** : Converts data from JSON to XML.
    * **XML to JSON** : Converts data from XML to JSON.
  * **Property Name** : Enter the name of the property which contains the data to convert.



## Node options[#](#node-options "Permanent link")

These options are available regardless of the **Mode** you select:

  * **Attribute Key** : Enter the prefix used to access the attributes. Default is `$`.
  * **Character Key** : Enter the prefix used to access the character content. Default is `_`.



All other options depend on the selected **Mode**.
